# ESO Pledge Tracker
A simple CLI script to find out what the undaunted pledges are without logging into ESO.  
For some reason, ESO doesn't have any APIs (as far as I can tell) that lets me get that information automatically so we're literally hard-coding the sequence of dungeons on rotation for each NPC quest giver.  
Therefore, every time a new dungeon is added, this will have to be updated. Joy.  

Do add-ons already exist in-game to get this information? Probably yeah. But the point is to *not* log into the game to know this info. Because I'm lazy.

## Requirements

- Python
