# ESO Pledge Tracker

### \* Up to date as of Patch 25 (Harrowstorm) \*

A project that started as a simple CLI program to find out what the Undaunted Pledges are without logging into ESO (Elder Scrolls Online).  
For some reason, ESO doesn't have any out-of-game APIs that lets me get any information. Therefore, I grabbed the relevant data about dungeons, pledge timings, and dungeon sets, threw them into csv files, and made this simple python program to query that data.  

Do add-ons already exist in-game to get this information? Probably, yeah. But the point is to _not_ log into the game to know this info. Because I'm lazy, but apparently not lazy enough given that I wrote this whole thing.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (written with 3.7)

## Running This Project
Assuming you're in the project root:

`python -m eso_pledge_tracker.ept [-h] [-d <days>] [-l] [-v] [-n <query>] [--version] [--debug]`

## Running the Tests
This project uses unittest, so feel free to run with whatever additional arguments you like.  

`python -m unittest` should do the trick.

## Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-d <days>` | Print the dungeons for `days` before or after today's date<br>If no arguments are specified, or no flags are specified, default to this function and assume the current date |
| `-n <query>` | Searches for any dungeons containing `query` or with an item set with `query` in it, case-insensitive, and prints when the dungeon is happening next<br>If multiple words are required for the query, be sure to surround them with quotation marks |
| `-l, --list`     | List all of the undaunted pledges, starting with the current dungeon |
| `-v, --verbose`  | Make the output more verbose (i.e. list the dungeon sets for each dungeon) |
| `-h, --help`     | Show the help message and exit |
| `--version`      | Show program's version number and exit |
| `--debug`        | Print the argument parser's argv values for debugging purposes |
